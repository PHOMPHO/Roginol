<h1 style="text-transform:lowercase;font-size:38px;">about</h1>
<hr>

<div style="height:600px;overflow:auto;">
Roginol is a lonely warrior who once served Lord Darigan's military in the golden days of his kingdom, before the city floated omnosly in the sky and way before the curse of the Orb took over their bodies and their minds.<br><br>
Roginol is a quiet and gloomy woman who generally prefers to not stand out, but because of the curse, her mental state had declined significantly. She has an uncontrollable urge to not hurt others, which causes paranoia. Deep down, she is a more of a hopeless romantic type of person - dreaming of a world of peace and equality. When happy she smiles softly, which many would say does not fit in with her tough demeanor, and while under stress she tends to toughen her stance and poise in an attempt to hide her anxious thoughts. With an emotionless, almost sad, face most of the time, she only emotes in extreme situations.<br><br>
Even after so many years after the end of the war, she still sees no way of reparing the horrible reputation gained after the curse. She can still vividly remember parts of the tragedy and the lives she took while being influenced by curse. It very much still haunts her nightmares and has lead to the feeling of guilt never trully vanishing, no matter how much good she may give to the world.<br><br>
Seeing her life as nothing more than spendable, in the last few years she has decided to dedicate the herself to protecting a young girl she found while traveling around the country-side. Feeling guilty for the lonely life of the girl, they both seet out in a journey together as roginol saw the exchange as a way to use her power and skill in a less destructive way.

<div style="height:600px;overflow:auto;padding-right:10px;">
As a child, The girl grew up in the peaceful farms around the Lord's land with her single father, who knew her heart was supposed to be elsewhere, but was afraid of where that fiery passion inside of her would end up. Always fascinated by the way of the sword and the knights of Darigan, the child, who did everything she could to become one, ended up as one of the first female generals of Lord Darigan, beginning her job by protecting the city from the creatures around it. Now, after the red bath left behind by the war, she walks Neopia in search of answers and a way to redeem herself for the harm she has done to so many.<br><br>
while in the army she rose quickly through the ranks thanks to her incredible skill, which didn't go unoticed by her peers. while many saw her as nothing more than a show-off and not deserving of her acolades, another much smaller group in the heigher ranks saw the potential of using such skill for their military campains.<br><br>
the imminent war against meridell proved her ascension to be in good timing as not long after The Orb that once brought prosperity and happiness was stolen. what seemed like nothing soon turned sour as a horrible curse befell all those who carried the darigan blood in their veins. turning military and civilians alike.<br><br>
those affected showed increased hostility and a hivemind-like behaviour in search of The Orb. nothing could stand in their way and using their hands or any other tools at their disposal the people of darigan attacked their neighboring lands in a frenzy.<br><br>
as the curse was broken, the changes in their bodies remained. the scars, horns and dark marks of the afflicted stood the test of time, segregating them from the rest of the world.

Even if she meant no harm to others, Roginol did collect quite a few enemies, be it the many villages who wanted absolutely nothing to do with the spawns of Darigan, as they began to be called after the curse had passed, or the roguish people she entered the way of to help someone else. But the biggest one of them all was Talise Caparelli, a wanted criminal who only knew how to hurt others, a dragonic creature that wanted nothing but riches, everything she standed for was the complete opposite of what Roginol believed in, a recipe for disaster had already been written when the two met for the first time.<br><br>
Roginol had accepted a bounty to find and end a draik who had been messing around and stealing from the village for a very long time, knowing she would find such creature in the surrounding forest she made her way to the dark and damp cavern only to find Talise relishing and laughing in her throne of bones. The lengthy battle that ensued between the two women was like an epic battle of old, but as sleazy as Talise was, she fled the duel only to spite the other one. Since those days the two have been at war whenever they meet.

Beyond the curse and subsequent to the girl roaming the lands for quite a few years, Roginol met with a young girl that seemed to be living in one of the Citadels old villages on her own, the dirty clothes suggested she was a farm maiden, but her cheerful nature almost made it seem like a curse had never affected the young one at all, even if the marks where still there - darkened hands and horns. Tired of being pestered for many many miles out of their initial meeting location, Roginol decided to let the girl accompany her, even if her instincts at first were to send the girl away in the incessant fear of not being able to protect the young one.<br><br>
With this unexpected encounter, Roginol continued her adventures, but now with a partner, Wendy Duval, a 14 year old girl full of life and cheerfulness that loved to frolic around alongside the older woman. On their very first stop, while the woman told her to stay hidden under a cape, was a small village close to Brightvalle, the young girl met for the first time those who did not like the spawns of Darigan, an old man confronted Roginol over why she dared to enter their lands and corrupt their surroundings, the calm woman simply bowed and gave her apologies, turning around and trying to leave the town without causing problems when the angry man began to scream and pulled the cape only to reveal the young girl.<br><br>
Everything after that felt like a scene in slow-motion, the man grabbed the girls arm screaming to the others as she flayed around trying to run away, but with a single swift move, Roginol took Wendy back into her arms, prepared to see the consequences of her action to the end. But the young one plead for them to leave, Roginol turned her back to the village and ran as far as she could.

<hr>
<div style="height:650px;overflow:auto;margin-bottom:15px;padding-right:10px;">
      <p><b>First of the Month of Gathering, Year xx</b><br>
- Dearest new diary, Papa just gifted me with this beautiful blank book and told me to write about my day in it since I don't have many friends to talk to.<br>
I've been 13 for quite a few months and yet I don't feel any different from before, the other day I saw Lesser around the market and almost couldn't recognize him!<br>
I didn't have the courage to talk to him... But it doesn't matter, once I train harder and prove to him I can become part of the military I'll have enough courage!<br>
Papa doesn't like that idea, but I don't want to be in the farm forever!<br><br></p>
<p><b>The 22th of the Month of Relaxing, Year xx</b><br>
- Today was my 15th birthday, Father seemed a bit worried about the recent rumors about Meridell's King making advances towards the Citadel, but still took his time to celebrate with me, he even got me a real sword!<br>
I can finally enter the trials for Lord Darigan's military!<br>
I won't let the boys make fun of my dream, they have no idea what they are talking about, who said a girl can't fight?<br>
Surely someone that knows nothing about girls!<br>
I've gotten quite a bit better over the last few weeks, but I wonder what the others are like...<br><br></p>
<p><b>The xxth of the Month of ------- Year xx</b><br>
- May be marked in history that today I leave to become the first female private in the Citadels military!<br>
I've conquered the trials with ease after so many years training just for this, I hope to be the first of many others that may see this as an opportunity.<br>
No man can match my skil or strength.<br>
Father cried very much with the news that I will be departing to the Citadel, but this is my dream and I can't give up now, I've already proved many others wrong.<br><br></p>

<h1 style="font-size:38px;">Prologue</h1>
<hr>
<div style="height:650px;overflow:auto;margin-bottom:15px;padding-right:10px;">
<p>On the twenty second day of the month of relaxing, a new little creature was hatched in the land surrounding what would soon be known as the Darigan Citadel, this small creature was called Roginol. This small child had always been curious about the outside world and what was beyond the fields that seemed to have no end, the Gardiner Farm was quite spacious and had many different kinds of fruits and vegetables growing under the care of her father, a man who traveled around Neopia in search of farming knowledge.</p>

<p>During his long journey, he had the luck to find his significant other, Roginols mother, a striking woman that had no fear to do as she pleased, her beauty was unmatched, the long, flowing, red hair shaped her sleek face and thunderous blue eyes that seemed to glow with determination, her smile was contagious to everyone around, but her impulsiveness led the woman a tortuous path in life, but it also led to the birth of Roginol, which she was very happy about, but the woman could not commit to spending her life in a farm and doing nothing more than that.</p>

<p>While settling down on the farm to raise the young child, the man felt a happiness he had never experienced before, but little did he know his partner didn't feel as happy, being around the small growing creature who was so eager to listen and learn about everything was able to warm the hearts of both, which delayed the older woman's departure by a whole year. But at that moment, as happy as she felt, she couldn't ignore it anymore, her heart yearned for adventure and adrenaline, hearing that the man felt heartbroken, but still knew he couldn't trap a free bird in a cage and expect them to sing happily forever, so they parted their ways while the small child remained in the farm to learn and grow.</p>

<p>Around the age of 5, Roginol began to meet the other children who lived in the surrounding farming area, one of them being Lesser, a brave young boy who's dream was to become a hero of the now established Citadel of Darigan, always reciting the stories of old and acting them out with the other children. While alone, the two would always sit by the lake, which perched not far into the forest that enclosed the continent and the areas of the land itself, spending long hours and hours just imagining and talking about what it would be like to travel and see so many different places and people.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes the young girl, however, began to develop feelings for the young boy whom she was so close to, but also for the idea of fighting for her people and protecting the lands, so, at the age of 10, she began to train with the boy so both would enter the trails of the lord together, but that did not sit well with the other boys that also wanted to become knights of the military, even if Lesser would fight and argue against them about how backwards they were being, the others would still pester the girl about how she could never enter the military nor fight for anyone. Despite those awful experiences with others, however, her desire to prove those horrible children wrong were only fueled even more, and so began to burn the flame that moved Roginol to fight and train every single day.</p>

<p>During those years, meanwhile, her father was very much against those dreams just as much as the boys, but he could never have stopped her from trying and training to fulfill them, and after noticing that she was not going to stop even if he or the rest of the people didn't approve of it, he finally decided to give into her determination, which reminded him very much of his past significant other, which scared the man to death since the girl was very much growing to be just like her mother. But even shaken by his own fears, at her 15th birthday, he made a very difficult decision to actually outwardly support her during this arduous journey, giving her a brand new steel sword he commissioned off of a friend on the Citadel. More than happy, the girl thanked her father with all her heart, and decided to train even harder to make the old man proud.</p>

<p>Whilst, her feelings for the boy, Lesser, only grew deeper, wraping around her hearth like the thorns of a prickly rose, yet the two also only grew apart with the passage of time, the boys interest hadn't changed at all, but he also knew he wouldn't be able to win standing by the side of someone no one wanted to see succeed, or so was what all of the others started to plant in his head, and while that hurt his feelings just as much, he saw no other way around it, he had to separate himself from Roginol. With a heavy heart that weight like a block of pure silver, the boy confronted her, saying horrible things only to stop her from looking for him ever again, the girl cried with every word that felt like sharp blades breaking her heart into tiny pieces.</p>

<p>Miserable after that encounter and with those heavy feelings in her chest, the girl decided to prove every single one of them all wrong, they surely were very wrong about all of this. And with a broken heart, she continued her training with even more rage and a flame that burned even brighter inside of her, she had no more reason to hold back at all.  And as the years passed, that passion the once little girl had showed had only grown deeper and deeper to feel the hole left behind by the young man, and began twisting into a desire to actually prove to the whole world she could be just as good, if not even better than a man with a sword, which horrified and scared the old man very much, he had already lost his significant other for that same impulsiveness, was he going to lose his child as well?</p>

<div class="boxes" style="border-radius:5px;float:left;width:95%;margin-bottom:32px;">
<h1 style="font-size:38px;">Chapter 1 - The Path to the Citadel</h1>
<hr>
<div style="height:650px;overflow:auto;margin-bottom:15px;padding-right:10px;">
<p>After such a miserable and despair inducing nightmare of a day, Roginol layed her head on the fluffy pillow that adorned her small but comfortable bed, thoughts swirling around her head, how did it get to this? Did the others hate her that much? The girl couldn't answer, and she didn't want an answer, so she blocked those feelings out, she would never speak or think of them ever again. So the mornings came and went, and 4 whole years had already gone by in a flash, the girl had grown in every sense, the muscles in her body ached in pain after such arduous training every single day and night, her worried father couldn't do a thing about it other than pray she would not destroy her body. But the day to end her wait finally came, at 19 years old she was ready to finally face the tests known as the "Trials of Darigan", a series of physical assessments that had to be completed to enter the Citadels military.</p>
<p>Every year a few of the citizens from all over the region competed against one another in the trials, but even fewer were ever able to complete all of them, ending with years were only one or two participants were chosen, but she wasn't afraid anymore, the girl had honed her abilities enough to crush anything on her way, the only thing that could ever stop her was her own father. The man feared for the girls life very much, even if he knew she would never stop, "please my dear, don't do this to yourself...", his words felt like blades of steel, but Roginol couldn't turn back anymore, "I'm sorry father, but I can't let them doubt me any longer", and with those last words, she took the first step out of the Gardiner farm, for the first time she was heading for the Citadel with no intent on coming back.</p>
<p>Her path, however, would not be an easy one, the farms that cultivated the food for the markets on the Citadel where located quite a few miles away from the town itself, but with steady steps the girl made her way through the forest and meadows while her eyes danced around, she knew something was lurking in the shadows of the trees, and her guard was never down. The gigantic creature, a grey werelupe, jumped in a single movement over the bushes with it's claws ready to dig into her, but with a single strike the girl pulled the sword from her back and cut her foe down to the ground. The adrenaline rushed in her veins while her hands shook in desperation, she had never in her life used her skils for anything other than training, with her calm facade shattered by the creature that now blocked the path behind her, the girl feel to her knees, her now stained sword in the ground.</p>
<p>The sword, once light as a feather, now seemed to weight as much as the monster itself, but her conviction quickly snapped back in place, she couldn't dwell on that no more! Her path wasn't getting any shorter, so the girls stride quickened in a hurried state, while her mind processed what had just happened, her body moved on it's on to the Citadels gate. As the forest ended and the path became paved by stone her heart slowed down with her steps, she was almost at the entrance to the city, but something did not feel right. Just as she looked to the side of the road the marks left by heavy boots grabbed her attention in a second, who could have been entering the forest in such an awkward spot? With her curiosity peaked and a bit of time to spare, Roginol entered the clearing left behind by what seemed to be a military unity bearing a coat of arms that seemed quite familiar to her, many thoughts danced around her head, but they were all interrupted by the loud voices of the men approaching the camp.</p>

<p>."I surly wonder what King Skarl even wants with this place", the brunette soldier said laughing, his face dripping wet and his helmet under one of his arms, "It's probably just another meaningless little war, nothing we can't deal with", the other, who seemed to be a lot older than the others, spouted out while putting the helmet back on his head. They hadn't yet noticed her, but the girls body simply couldn't move once again, the news truly were real, Meridell was planning an attack on Darigan, after all. While frozen in time inside her own head, the group of three or four man took notice of the girl, "What do you think you are doing here?", "She has a sword... we shouldn't let out guard down", "it's just a girl, are you really afraid of her?", none of their words, however, reached her ears, but as she turned around without even thinking they all reacted as a treat, they couldn't have imagined she had such strong muscle memory, but whiting seconds, Roginol had already took her sword in her hand and blocked the incoming attack from the brunette soldier, who now dropped his helmet to the ground only to hold his sword with both hands. Even after putting the weight of his whole body on the sword he couldn't move the girls sword a single inch.</p>

<p>."Don't you dare attack me in such an undignified way, you skamelar mutt", the girl uttered through the teeth while pushing her sword forward with so much strength the man was almost kneeling at her feet. Taken aback by her sheer strength the man moved out of the swords way only to almost get hit by it, gaining a new scratch to adorn his shining armour, while letting out a scream of pure dread, "This is no ordinary girl, this but a monster!", turning around once more, Roginol shafted the sword back on it's sheath and resumed her way to the Citadels gate at once. The thoughts in her head were still a jumbled mess of conspiracies, there was no real reason for, what seemed like, a whole order to be scouting around the kingdom other than a war, and there was also no way Lord Darigan hadn't noticed it yet.</p>

<p>As Roginol got closer to the gate, the soldiers stopped her asking for identification, the entrance to the city had always been a long process, but during the trials it seemed to be even more difficult. Showing the two men the letter she had received from the court accepting her entrance on the trials they sneered letting a condescending chuckle out as the girl took the black papered letter back and crossed the gate, "there's no way a woman will ever be able to endure the trials", those words cut the girls heart in tiny pieces, her skils were again being judged by something she had no control over, "I'll prove them all wrong", she muttered to herself while walking and looking at her feet, only to bump into someone else, "I'm so-", her words cut off as she looked up to meet their gaze.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:38px;">The Letter</h1>
<hr>
<div style="height:650px;overflow:auto;margin-bottom:15px;padding-right:10px;">
<b>The xxth of the Month of ------, Year xx</b><br><p>Dearest Father, I'm  very sorry for not sending notice sooner, the life in the Citadel is a lot more chaotic than I was expecting. All of my comrades saw my fights during the trials, it's almost like none of them trust me or as if they were scared of me... I was so very excited to meet the others, but it's fine, I've completed my goal, now I have to work even harder to get into the higher ranks and prove that I deserved to be here. The pay isn't as bad as I expected, to tell you the truth, I can go by quite well with it, but I might get a few side jobs to help you with the costs of the farm, I know it's been hard taking care of everything on your own. I overheard some of the other soldiers talking about how they had been making a lot of money from hunts and mercenary work for other villages,  I could probably try my hand at that.</p>
<p>I know you've been worrying about my well-being, Father, please rest assured and trust my words when I say it, I've been taking good care of my health during this times of change, and the training provided by the academy isn't as harsh as everyone makes it seem to be. I haven't yet been deployed anywhere, but I believe they will be sending me to the northern forest soon, the werelupe problems seem to be only getting worse on those parts, I wonder why... They have quite a big village close to that area, which, contrary to our own, has been fighting the monsters since the beginning of time. Whenever I can I'll make sure to visit the farm to see you, even though I'm sure Lesser has been very angry at me since the opening of the trials... hope he can forgive me for going so hard on him during our battle, I truthfully did not mean to hurt him, ever, please, send my regards to him.</p>
<p>At this moment, General Lord Kass and General Galgarroth have been investigating the weird troops from Meridell that have been going around the forest line in front of the Citadels gate and surrounding area, I myself saw a few of them when coming back to the city the other day, they've been worried sick that Meridell might be trying to start a war of some sort with us since they've received a peace treaty from Brightvale. I had heard you commenting about this with some of the others, but I have no real news so far, I promise to update you if anything happens here or if I discover something that has been going on. Please take care and send me news when you can, I promise I'll try and send letters more often than this.<br><br>

- My best regards to everyone, Roginol</p>

<p>As Roginol walked inside the small town a woman that seemed not much younger than herself came rushing to seek help, "please, please, help me and my brother, they've stolen all our food, please, warrior!", sobbing and tugging at Roginols cape the woman pointed at an alleyway, "we can't just ignore this!", the little girls voiced was high pitched and worried, but Wendy was quite right, she couldn't just ignore such a desperate request, even if she didn't quite know if they were welcome in this town or not. Gently nudging the younger woman aside, she took out her sword from it's sheath while taking silent steps towards the dimly lit alleyway, a thief, or a band of them, was something she didn't take lightly, seeing it as nothing more than a lack of honor and respect.</p>
<p>As the shadows got closer and she could peak inside to understand the situation, Roginol saw a scene out of a medieval novel, the boy, who seemed to be slightly older then the sister from before, was drenched in red, his face bruised and a swollen eye while the other three or four man only laughed and kept on going with their one way fight. With red boiling inside her veins, she sprinted directly into combat waiving her sword close enough to their faces to scare them but slightly far and dismissively enough to not hurt them, "how dare you pick on the weak you bunch of cmberworlds!", her almost thunderous voice echoed throughout the small and dark space like the growl of an resentful beast. The group of thieves took a step back getting cornered into the mossy wall, "how dare a woman interrupt us?", a scraggly man shouted while pointing at Roginol and ordering his companions to attack.</p>
<p>The group of men jumped at her with knives and daggers in hand, she moved her feet and played her sword with grace, knocking them down one by one while trying to hold herself back, from the outside it almost seemed like the woman was floating in mid air while cutting down her enemies and dodging their mildly coordinated attacks. Landing on her feet after such acrobatics, she felt the warm red liquid adorn her left cheek while the scraggly man laughed and looked down on her, "did you really think I cared about honor? or these fopdoodles? life isn't that kind of faerie tale, girl!", cleaning the liquid off her face and noticing the horrified face of the beat up kid, Roginol sneered at the man, letting out an erratic laughter, "I don't know what real life is? I don't think you know what you are talking about, you chewed dog!", throwing the heavy steel sword with one of her hands and engraving it in between the stone bricks, the woman kept on laughing while the red liquid dripped down the mans face, panicked with her maniacal state the man ran off into the darkness cursing her for everything.</p>
<p>Dusting herself off and setting the sword free from the bricks, Roginol turned around to check up on the man who had apparently been beat into almost a pulp of flesh and red liquid, extending a gentle hand and an expresionless face she began to question, "what happened here?", her gentle voice was quite startling to young man, who accepted the helping hand to get up while brushing the liquid off his face with the back of his hand, "just what always happens...", the mans gaze danced around the alley before finally locking on the brown-ish bag on the ground, "at least this time they didn't take the food", with a chuckle he scourged around the contents and threw an apple the Roginol, who cached it in her hands with delicate fingers, "it's not much, but it's the least I can do to pay for your help", with a crooked smile because of the pain, he walked out of the alleyway to meet his jumping sister, who tightly hugged him, "dear lord, you are ok, please don't do that again!", she urged the young man.</p>
<p>With an apathetic sigh, she walked out of the shadows to find Wendy pacing around in a single line, worried about the well-being of the older one, "please don't cause damage to the town, we don't have money for that", Roginol said jokingly while the girl opened a bright smile and hugged the others waist, "I'm glad you are back".</p>

<p>Wendy sat down at the edge of the river, submerging her feet on the running water while Roginol took off the scattered plates of armor from her body, "don't you regret going trough so much to achieve your dreams only to end up like this?", the young girl asked, turning her head slightly to see the other, she thought about her years training in the farm, the trials, Lord Darigan, the war, she didn't regret any of it, the misery of it weighed heavy on her heart, but she wouldn't have changed her decision, "no, not at all", the woman answered while sitting on the ground, her back propped against a big and old tree.</p>
<p>Confused the young girl scrunched her face in disapproval, "is there nothing about all of this that you regret? at all?", the denial was quite evident on her voice, which took the woman by surprise, "if I always stopped to anlyse and regret the past I would never walk forward at all", but the succinct answer only confused Wendy even more, "is there nothing you actually regret?", her tone had shifted from absolute denial to complete curiosity, the older one could never understand how that child was so expressive after witnessing such tragedy, but thinking back to her younger days she was also quite expressive, wasn't she?</p>
<p>Maybe there are one or two things I regret not saying", Roginol answered honestly, the two people that came to her head when thinking about regret had always been the only two men in her life who mattered more than the fighting or the work - her father and Lesser. Looking up at the scattered sunshine raining down on her through the leaves she left out a chuckle, "I imagine you are waiting to hear what those were, right?", nodding attentively, Wendy scooted herself over and heard attentively to the tale.</p>
<p>."While I still lived in the farm with my father we had only a single fight, I was about 19 years old at the time, the post boy had just delivered my black letter, the coat of arms that adorned wax seal on the envelope made it clear that I had been accepted for the trials, he had always disprove of my ways, but he now had reason to act on them and convince me not to go. During that day I hid the letter under my pillow, scared of his reaction, but it didn't take long before he found it and came my way to question it. For the first time in my whole life I heard fathers stern voice shout in my direction, 'you know how dangerous this is, how dare you hide it from me', he shouted while pointing to the letter, I screamed back, cursing him for wanting to stop me, no matter what he or any other said to me, I had decided to take that burden upon myself. That night I slept with a heavy heart, and the next day I parted to the Citadel... at the time I was so angry I didn't say a word to him, the only times we talked were thought letters, horrible letters were I could not convey how sorry I was for not telling him how much I loved him for everything he had done.</p>
<p>With her jaw slightly dropped and the depth of regret on her Roginols voice, Wendy nudged herself closer to the older woman and laid her fluffy hair on her shoulder, "I'm sure he knew how much you loved him", the young girl said with a reassuring smile on her face, "I sure hope so... because I never had the courage to say it to his face, and in the end... by my hands... he would never be able to hear it", almost as if a flash of memory overcame her sight, Roginol looked at her hands that seemed to flash back to the old Gardiner state, covered in red liquid and back again to reality in the forest.</p>
